Filters are the selectors in the collection's find operation. It matches documents
in the collection depending on the criteria provided and returns a set of documents,
a.k.a Cursor.

Each filtering criteria is based on a field of a document. If the field
is indexed, the find operation takes the advantage of it and only scans
the index map for that field. But if the field is not indexed, it scans
the whole collection.
